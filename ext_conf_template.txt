	# cat=basic; type=string; label=Configuration extension: This extension will hold all generated files (tca.php, ext_tables.sql, LLXML files, etc.) and acts just as container - it does not have to contain any code files when installed. When not set all this configuration gets stored in the kb_kickstarter extension directory. The extension can be a simple "empty" extension containing nothing except the files required for installation (i.e. the "nothing" extension ;). The "kickadmin" tool contains a menu option for creating such an empty extension.
