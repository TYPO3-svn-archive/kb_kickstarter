The question raised wheter it would be better to have the properties-table only containing "real" database fields.

Or if the table shall contain a "flexform" field, in which all the properties for different types of properties get
stored. 

The advantages of storing all property-information in database fields, would be that search for specific properties
is easier, data can get pulled out of database and used directly for rendering the kickstarted tables. Disadvantage
of this method, is that database must get dynamically adopted when new fields get added. For two different properties
there can't be a configuration-value which has different types (i.e. integer and varchar).

When XML/Flexforms is used there must be a step in between where XML is converted to an array, and overlaid over the
data from the property-row.

As searching is not that important the advantages of Flexforms for properties seem to win this case.
